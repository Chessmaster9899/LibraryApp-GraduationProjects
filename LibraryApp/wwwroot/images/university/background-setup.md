# University Background Image

## Setup Instructions

To add a custom background image to your LibraryApp:

1. **Place your background image** in this folder with the name `background.png`
2. **Recommended specifications:**
   - Format: PNG (for best quality with transparency support)
   - Resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
   - File size: Under 2MB for optimal loading
   - Style: Subtle, not too busy to ensure text readability

3. **Image guidelines:**
   - Use images with soft colors and low contrast
   - Avoid images with lots of text or fine details
   - University campus photos work well
   - Abstract patterns or gradients are also good choices

4. **Alternative names supported:**
   - `background.png` (primary)
   - `background.jpg` 
   - `background.jpeg`

The application will automatically apply a semi-transparent overlay to ensure content readability while showing your background image.
